# ClarusMensAPI â€“ Project Specification (Post-MVP)

## Goal

ClarusMensAPI aims to be a robust AI-driven API that generates structured answers, learning questions, and quizzes based on user input, expanding beyond the MVP to improve functionality, usability, and security.

## Core Features

### 1. **Advanced Answer Generation**

- Allow configurable answer length and depth (concise, detailed, step-by-step).
- Introduce domain-specific responses (e.g., programming, science, history).

### 2. **Enhanced Learning Features**

- **Dynamic Quiz Generation**: Automatically generate quizzes based on API responses.
- **Multiple Answer Formats**: Support multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, and open-ended questions.
- **Difficulty Scaling**: Adjust quiz difficulty based on user interaction or request.

### 3. **User & API Management**

- **Authentication & Authorization**
  - OAuth2 or JWT authentication.
  - API key management with role-based access control.
- **User Accounts & Profiles**
  - Track API usage per user.
  - Store quiz history, and preferences.
- **Usage Analytics & Logs**
  - Provide API usage statistics.
  - Log AI response performance and request trends.

### 4. **Security & Rate Limiting**

- **Advanced Rate Limiting**: Implement adaptive rate limiting to prevent abuse.
- **Spam & Malicious Input Detection**: Use AI to detect inappropriate or harmful queries.

## Deployment & Infrastructure

- **Hosting**: Continue using Railway
- **Database**: If required, PostgreSQL or MongoDB for storing structured data.
- **CI/CD**: Implement automated testing and deployment pipelines.
- **Monitoring & Alerts**: Integrate logging and monitoring tools to track API health.

## Future Considerations

- **Multilingual Support**: Extend AI models to support multiple languages.

This specification builds upon the MVP, ensuring that ClarusMensAPI evolves into a powerful, scalable, and secure AI-driven API for learning and knowledge generation.
