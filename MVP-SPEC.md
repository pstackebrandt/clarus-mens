# ClarusMensAPI MVP Scope

## Goal

ClarusMensAPI is an ASP.NET Minimal API designed to process user questions and generate structured answers using AI.

## Core Features

1. **Input Validation**  
   - Validate user input for length, allowed characters, and other necessary constraints to ensure data integrity.  
   - Return an error response if input does not meet requirements.

2. **AI-Powered Answer Generation**  
   - Process valid questions using an AI model.  
   - Return a structured response based on AI-generated content.

3. **Security & Rate Limiting**  
   - API key-based authentication to prevent unauthorized access.  
   - Rate limiting to control request frequency and avoid misuse.  
   - Logging for monitoring and preventing abuse.

4. **API Documentation**  
   - Provide an OpenAPI (Swagger) specification.  
   - Include example requests and responses.

## Deployment

- Host the API on **Railway** for automated deployments.  
- Use **GitHub** for version control and collaboration.

This MVP focuses on ensuring the API reliably processes valid questions and returns meaningful AI-generated responses while maintaining security and usability.
